# Word-Snake-Volcabulary Project: August 2021 - October 2021

Used Java code to implement the game to search a word in the English dictionary and returns the meanings of the word in English. 
•	Rule: The user is required to type a word that has its first letter matched the last letter of the previous word. The user should be able to finish the game in one minute because a timer thread will count down the clock while executing the program. Finally, the code will reflect how many correct words that the user made.
